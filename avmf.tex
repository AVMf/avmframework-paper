\title{\name ~--- An Open Source Framework and Implementation for use of the \\ Alternating Variable Method}
\author{Suppressed for double-blind review}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The Alternating Variable Method (AVM) has been shown to be a particularly fast and effective local search technique in search-based software engineering.%, particularly test data generation.
%
Recent developments to the AVM have generalized the type of representation it can optimize, while others have provably improved its runtime for certain types of fitness landscape. However, there has been no publicly-available code implementation of these algorithms. We introduce \name, a  fully object-oriented framework, written in Java, that provides such an implementation. \name is ready for download and configuration for use in SBSE projects.
